Installation steps
------------------
Install the following required third-party libraries:
- [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/) (ROSPy and paramiko, two python modules required by this software, are bundled as part of the ROS package)
- [PyQt](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) (PyQt 4.10.2, Qt4 version)
- [pyqtgraph](http://www.pyqtgraph.org/)
- [mapnik](http://mapnik.org/) (package name: python-mapnik)

ROS setup tips:
- Ensure that the ~/.bashrc file contains the correct ROS\_IP and ROS\_MASTER\_URI values.

SSH connection tips:
- Get the LandShark black_box host key (use 'ssh-keyscan -t rsa <landshark\_ip>')
- Copy the host key to the local ~/.ssh/known_hosts file
- Ensure the 'hacms.cfg' file exists and contains the correct values (IP address, etc.)
