# This file demonstrate the stale flag
#
# The subscriber twice_as_fast is expected to have the stale flag every two activations since its frequency is twice the one of the publisher.
#
# The subscriber never_stale should never have a stale flag since its period is longer than the publisher's one plus the channel latency. Note that at the beginning it may be started before the publisher, in which case it will have stale flags at the beginning.
