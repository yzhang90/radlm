  radler.sh is a simple bash script used to run the actual python radler script radler/main.py

* The radler script
The script may be used to do handle object files with the subcommands =obj_version= and =obj_compatible= or to compile a radl description with the =compile= subcommand.
The script has two levels of arguments. The arguments before the subcommand and the one after, specific to the subcommand.
*** Generic arguments
The full list of arguments is provided by the =--help= argument.
***** =--ws_dir=
This is used to specify where is the workspace directory. The workspace directory is where the files are generated. This is by default equalt to ~src~.
*** Compile subcommand
The full list of arguments for the =compile= subcommand is available as the =--help= argument to the subcommand (=radler.sh compile --help=).
***** The radl description file
The radl description file is a positional compulsory argument. It has to be a file with the '.radl' extension.
***** =--object_files=
To compile a radl description which depends on other modules, one has to give the object files of those modules with this argument.
***** =--object_dest=
By default, the generated object file has the same name as its module, with the '.radlo' extension. Moreover it is by default written at the root of the workspace directory. This command allows to change the name and directory of the generated object file.
