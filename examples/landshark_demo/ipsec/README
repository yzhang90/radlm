# Create cfg file with hostname and IP addr. 
# The scripts uses this file to create config files for each host.
# This file should contain the machine names and the IP addresses. 
# For e.g see config/aravind.cfg

# Go to a build dir to make things cleaner
mkdir build
cd build

# Create private/public keys for all hosts
# This should be done once and shared across the machines
../scripts/make_keys.py ../plant.cfg

# Create racoon and setkey config files 
../scripts/config_ipsec.py ../plant.cfg

# Set appropriate permissions for the certificates
chmod go-rwx */etc/racoon/certs/*

# You will need to copy the files to each machine in the plant

# The other necessary things are setkey and racoon services (installing racoon install thoses services and set them to run at level S).
