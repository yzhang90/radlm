A multi-window z-test-based execution monitor. 

Compilation:
cd [PATH_TO_ROS_GROOVY_BASE]/cmu/
catkin_make

Running the monitor:
cd [PATH_TO_ROS_GROOVY_BASE]/cmu/
source devel/setup.sh
roslaunch landshark_cmu_monitor execution_monitor.launch

Usage:
The monitor is meant to detect discrepancies between the Landshark
displacement calculated from its GPS sensor, and from its wheel encoder-based
odometry. To be detectable, the discrepancies must be on average at least
as big as parameter acceptable_deviation.

Parameters:
Parameters can be set in launch/execution_monitor.launch. They are:
- max_anomaly: How much confidence (between 0 and 1) the algorithm must have
  before declaring an anomaly.
- obs_variance: The expected variance of observation values.
- acceptable_deviation: maximum normal long-term discrepancy between
  GPS-based displacement and odometry-based displacement.
